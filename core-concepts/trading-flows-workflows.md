# Trading Flows & Workflows

Trading flows are the brain of TradingFlow's automation system. They transform complex trading logic into intuitive visual workflows that anyone can understand and modify.

## Introduction to Visual Trading

### From Code to Visual Logic
Traditional trading automation requires programming skills:

```python
# Traditional approach - requires coding
if price < moving_average_20 and rsi < 30:
    if portfolio_balance > minimum_trade_size:
        execute_buy_order(amount=calculate_position_size())
        send_notification("Buy order executed")
```

TradingFlow transforms this into visual workflows:
```
Price Feed → Technical Analysis → Condition Logic → Buy Order → Notification
     ↓              ↓                ↓              ↓           ↓
  Live Price    RSI < 30      If conditions    Execute      Alert User
                MA20 Cross     are met         Trade
```

### Benefits of Visual Workflows
- **Intuitive Understanding**: See exactly how your strategy works
- **Easy Modification**: Drag and drop to change logic
- **Collaborative Development**: Share and discuss strategies visually
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Build and test ideas quickly
- **Debugging Simplicity**: Identify issues by following the visual flow

## Core Workflow Concepts

### Nodes: The Building Blocks

Every workflow consists of **nodes** - individual components that perform specific functions:

**Data Nodes**: Collect information
- Price Feed Node: Get current token prices
- X (Twitter) Listener Node: Monitor social sentiment
- Technical Analysis Node: Calculate indicators

**Decision Nodes**: Make logical choices  
- Condition Logic Node: If/then/else logic
- AI Model Node: Machine learning decisions
- Code Execution Node: Custom Python logic

**Action Nodes**: Execute operations
- Buy/Sell Node: Execute trades
- Vault Management Node: Deposit/withdraw funds
- Notification Node: Send alerts

**Utility Nodes**: Support operations
- Timer Node: Schedule periodic actions
- Math Operation Node: Perform calculations
- Dataset Node: Store and retrieve data

### Connections: The Data Flow

**Handles**: Input and output points on nodes
- **Input Handles**: Receive data from other nodes
- **Output Handles**: Send data to connected nodes
- **Handle Types**: Ensure compatible data connections

**Data Types**:
- **Numbers**: Prices, percentages, quantities
- **Strings**: Text, addresses, symbols
- **Booleans**: True/false conditions
- **Objects**: Complex data structures
- **Arrays**: Lists of items

### Signals: The Communication System

TradingFlow uses a **signal-based architecture** where nodes communicate through structured messages:

```json
{
  "type": "price_update",
  "data": {
    "symbol": "APT/USDC",
    "price": 8.45,
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "source": "hyperion_dex"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "latency_ms": 50
  }
}
```

## Workflow Execution Models

### Event-Driven Execution
Workflows respond to external events:
- **Price Changes**: Execute when price moves
- **Time Triggers**: Run on schedule (hourly, daily)
- **Social Signals**: React to Twitter mentions
- **Technical Indicators**: Respond to crossovers

### Continuous Monitoring
Some nodes run continuously:
- **Real-Time Price Feeds**: Constant market data
- **Social Media Monitoring**: Ongoing sentiment analysis
- **Portfolio Tracking**: Live balance updates
- **Risk Assessment**: Continuous position monitoring

### Batch Processing
Efficient execution for bulk operations:
- **Multi-Asset Rebalancing**: Update entire portfolio
- **Historical Analysis**: Process large datasets
- **Report Generation**: Create periodic summaries
- **Backup Operations**: Archive strategy data

## Advanced Workflow Features

### Conditional Logic and Branching

**Simple Conditions**:
```
Price Feed → Condition Node → Buy Node
                ↓
            Price < $8.00
```

**Complex Multi-Condition Logic**:
```
Price Feed ─────┐
                ├─→ AND Logic ─→ Buy Node
RSI Indicator ───┘       ↓
                    (Price < $8 AND RSI < 30)
```

**Branching Workflows**:
```
Market Analysis ─┬─→ Bull Market Strategy
                 │
                 ├─→ Bear Market Strategy  
                 │
                 └─→ Sideways Strategy
```

### Loops and Iterations

**DCA Loop Example**:
```
Timer (Weekly) → Check Balance → Buy $100 APT → Update Records
                      ↓                              ↑
                 Balance > $100 ←──────────────────┘
```

**Portfolio Rebalancing Loop**:
```
For Each Asset → Calculate Target → Compare Current → Rebalance
       ↓               ↓                ↓              ↓
   APT, USDC      20% target       Current: 15%    Buy 5% APT
```

### Error Handling and Recovery

**Try-Catch Logic**:
```
Execute Trade ─→ Success ─→ Update Portfolio
      ↓
   Error ─→ Retry Logic ─→ Send Alert ─→ Fallback Strategy
```

**Circuit Breakers**:
```
Monitor Losses ─→ Loss > 10% ─→ Emergency Stop ─→ Notify User
                      ↓
                Resume When ←─ Manual Override
```

## Workflow Templates and Patterns

### DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging)
**Pattern**: Regular purchases regardless of price
```
Timer Node → Price Check → Calculate Amount → Buy Order → Record
   ↓            ↓              ↓              ↓         ↓
 Weekly     Current Price   Fixed $100     Execute   Update Log
```

### Momentum Trading
**Pattern**: Buy when price is trending up
```
Price Feed → Moving Average → Trend Detection → Buy Signal
     ↓            ↓                ↓              ↓
Current MA    20-period MA    Price > MA      Execute Buy
```

### Mean Reversion
**Pattern**: Buy when price is below average
```
Price Feed → Bollinger Bands → Oversold Check → Buy Signal
     ↓            ↓                ↓              ↓
Current Price   Lower Band    Price < Band    Execute Buy
```

### Arbitrage Detection
**Pattern**: Profit from price differences
```
Exchange A Price ─┐
                  ├─→ Price Diff → Arbitrage Logic → Execute Trades
Exchange B Price ─┘       ↓             ↓              ↓
                      Diff > 2%    Buy A, Sell B    Profit Lock
```
