# Trading Flows & Workflows

Think of trading flows as visual recipes for making money. Instead of writing complex code, you connect simple building blocks to create powerful automated trading strategies.

## What are Trading Flows?

### The Visual Trading Revolution
Traditional trading bots require you to be a programmer. TradingFlow changes this completely:

**Before TradingFlow:**
"I want to buy Bitcoin when the price drops below $40,000 and I have enough money in my account."
→ Requires coding skills, debugging, and technical expertise

**With TradingFlow:**
"Price Monitor → Check if < $40,000 → Check Balance → Buy Bitcoin → Send Alert"
→ Just drag, drop, and connect visual blocks!

### Why Visual Workflows Work Better
- **See Your Strategy**: Understand exactly what your bot will do
- **Easy Changes**: Modify strategies by moving visual elements
- **Share Ideas**: Show others your strategy without explaining code
- **Quick Testing**: Build and test new ideas in minutes
- **Find Problems**: Spot issues by following the visual path

## Building Blocks: Understanding Nodes

### Data Collectors
These nodes gather information for your strategy:
- **Price Monitor**: "What's the current price of Bitcoin?"
- **Twitter Listener**: "What are people saying about this token?"
- **Technical Analysis**: "Is the price trending up or down?"
- **News Feed**: "Any major announcements today?"

### Decision Makers
These nodes help your strategy think:
- **Simple Conditions**: "Is the price below $40,000?"
- **Smart AI**: "Does this look like a good buying opportunity?"
- **Custom Logic**: "Should I buy based on multiple factors?"
- **Risk Check**: "Am I risking too much money?"

### Action Takers
These nodes execute your trading decisions:
- **Buy/Sell Orders**: "Execute this trade now"
- **Move Money**: "Transfer funds between accounts"
- **Send Alerts**: "Notify me about this trade"
- **Update Records**: "Log this transaction"

### Helpful Utilities
These nodes support your strategy:
- **Timer**: "Do this every Monday at 9 AM"
- **Calculator**: "How much should I buy?"
- **Storage**: "Remember this information for later"

## Popular Trading Strategy Templates

### Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)
**Perfect for Beginners**

This strategy buys a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price:

*"Every week, if I have $100 available, buy Bitcoin"*

**How it works:**
- Timer triggers every week
- Checks if you have $100 in your vault
- Buys $100 worth of Bitcoin
- Sends you a confirmation message

**Why it's popular:**
- Reduces impact of price volatility
- No emotional decision-making
- Perfect for long-term investing
- Works even if you're busy

### Buy the Dip
**For Opportunistic Traders**

This strategy buys when prices drop significantly:

*"When Bitcoin drops 10% in a day, buy with 25% of my available funds"*

**How it works:**
- Monitors Bitcoin price continuously
- Calculates daily price change
- Triggers buy when price drops 10%+
- Uses only a portion of funds (risk management)

### Momentum Trading
**For Trend Followers**

This strategy buys when prices are rising strongly:

*"When a token breaks above its 20-day average with strong volume, buy"*

**How it works:**
- Tracks price relative to moving averages
- Monitors trading volume
- Buys when both conditions align
- Sells when momentum fades

### Smart Rebalancing
**For Portfolio Managers**

This strategy maintains your desired asset allocation:

*"Keep my portfolio at 50% Bitcoin, 30% Ethereum, 20% stablecoins"*

**How it works:**
- Checks current portfolio allocation
- Compares to target percentages
- Buys/sells to rebalance when needed
- Runs monthly to avoid over-trading

## How Your Strategy Runs

### Trigger Events
Your strategy can start running based on:
- **Time**: "Every Monday at 9 AM"
- **Price Changes**: "When Bitcoin moves 5%"
- **News Events**: "When specific keywords trend on Twitter"
- **Technical Signals**: "When RSI drops below 30"

### Real-Time Monitoring
Once running, your strategy:
- Watches markets 24/7
- Processes data instantly
- Makes decisions automatically
- Keeps detailed logs of everything

### Safety Features
Built-in protections keep your funds safe:
- **Loss Limits**: Stop trading if losses exceed your comfort level
- **Emergency Stop**: Instantly pause all trading activity
- **Balance Checks**: Never trade more than you have
- **Sanity Checks**: Avoid obviously bad trades

## Success Stories

### Maria's DCA Success
*"I set up a simple DCA strategy buying $50 of Ethereum weekly. Over 8 months, I've invested $1,600 and my portfolio is now worth $2,100. The best part? I never had to think about timing the market."*

### James's Momentum Strategy
*"My momentum strategy caught three major rallies this year. While I missed some gains during quiet periods, I avoided major losses and ended up 40% ahead of buy-and-hold."*

### Lisa's Rebalancing Approach
*"My portfolio rebalancing strategy kept me disciplined. When Bitcoin pumped, it automatically sold some to buy more Ethereum and stablecoins. When Bitcoin crashed, it bought the dip with the profits from earlier sales."*
