# Vaults Explained

Vaults are the secure foundation of TradingFlow's automated trading system. Think of them as your personal trading accounts that can execute strategies autonomously while keeping your assets safe.

## What are TradingFlow Vaults?

### Core Concept
A vault is a smart contract that:
- **Holds your assets** securely on-chain
- **Executes trading strategies** based on your configured flows
- **Maintains complete transparency** with all transactions visible on-chain
- **Provides emergency controls** for maximum security

### Traditional Trading vs Vault Trading

| Traditional CEX | TradingFlow Vaults |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Custody on exchange | Self-custody with smart contracts |
| Limited automation | Full strategy automation |
| Platform risk | Decentralized security |
| Centralized control | User-controlled permissions |
| Opaque operations | Complete transparency |
