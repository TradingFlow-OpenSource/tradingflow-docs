# Nodes and Workflows

## 🔧 What is a Workflow?

TradingFlow is a workflow application. So, what is a workflow, and what is the smallest unit within it—the node?

## 📦 Nodes Explained

### Definition
A **node** is a functional module that encapsulates complex algorithms, data sources, or logical operations.

### Practical Example
Take the **X Listener Node** as an example:
- **Input:** User fills in the X account to monitor (e.g., `@realDonaldTrump`)
- **Output:** Retrieves the latest tweets from that account during runtime
- **Functionality:** Real-time monitoring of social media activity

## 🔗 Node Connections and Data Flow

### Inputs and Outputs
Each node has:
- **Input Ports** - Receive data from other nodes
- **Output Ports** - Send data to other nodes

### Signals and Logs
When multiple nodes' inputs and outputs are connected:
- **Signal** - Data content transmitted through the workflow
- **Log** - Process output during a single execution

## 🏗️ Node Components

A complete node consists of four parts:

1. **Inputs** - Receive external or upstream node data
2. **Outputs** - Send processing results to downstream nodes
3. **Signals** - Data content passed between nodes
4. **Logs** - Status and result records during execution

## 🌊 Building Workflows

**Workflow = Multiple Properly Connected Nodes**

By connecting nodes with different functions together, you can build powerful automated strategies:

```
Data Collection Node → Analysis Processing Node → Decision Node → Execution Node
```

### Practical Example
A simple dollar-cost averaging strategy workflow:

```
Timer Node → Price Query Node → Condition Node → Trade Execution Node → Notification Node
```

## 🎨 Visual Editing

TradingFlow provides an intuitive visual interface:
- **Drag and Drop** - Assemble nodes like puzzle pieces
- **Connect Lines** - Click to connect input and output ports
- **Real-Time Preview** - View workflow execution effects
- **Debug Tools** - Track the running status of each node
