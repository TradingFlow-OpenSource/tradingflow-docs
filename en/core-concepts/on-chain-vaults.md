# On-Chain Vaults

## 🔐 What are On-Chain Vaults?

TradingFlow follows the principles of decentralized applications and **does not custody users' private keys, wallets, or assets in any form**.

When users choose to deploy workflows on a blockchain network (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Aptos, Flow, etc.) and require trading capabilities, they need to create a corresponding on-chain "vault" in advance.

## ✨ Vault Features

### Fully Decentralized
- **User-Owned Only** - Vaults are completely controlled by users
- **Exclusive Access Rights** - Only users have deposit and withdrawal privileges
- **No Third-Party Trust** - TradingFlow team does not custody or misappropriate funds

### How It Works

1. When a user's workflow determines a trade should be executed
2. TradingFlow sends a signal to the on-chain vault
3. Transactions are executed through the blockchain network's decentralized exchange
4. The entire process is transparent and traceable, with funds always under user control
