# Development Background

TradingFlow is developed by a small team. Similar to the story of n8n's founders, we discovered that there was no easy-to-use, open workflow application in the Web3 world, so we launched this project in March 2025.

We continuously participated in various Web3 hackathons and won numerous top prizes. These early positive feedbacks showed us the huge demand from the masses for what workflow applications can bring, such as quantitative trading.

## Mission of Democratizing Quantitative Trading

We call our mission "Democratizing Quantitative Trading." This is easy to understand: in the past, only 5% of top engineering and trading technical personnel could profit through automated trading. In the wave of artificial intelligence, we hope to empower everyone with this capability.

TradingFlow's goal is to break down technical barriers and allow ordinary users to enjoy the convenience brought by automated trading and quantitative strategies. We believe that through lowering usage thresholds and providing intuitive tools, financial innovation in the Web3 world should not belong only to a technical elite minority.

## Open Source and Decentralization

Based on business realities, we will adopt a progressive decentralization approach to open source work. The first batch we open sourced is the on-chain vault part, which you can view through this link:

- [TradingFlow Contracts on GitHub](https://github.com/TradingFlow-OpenSource/tradingflow-contracts)

As the project develops and matures, we plan to gradually open source more core components. This progressive approach both ensures the sustainable development of the project and allows the community to gradually participate in ecosystem construction. We believe that true decentralization requires time and the joint efforts of the community to achieve.

## Join the Community

TradingFlow's growth depends on community support. Whether you are a developer, trader, designer, or content creator, we welcome your participation and contributions. Everyone can find their place in this ecosystem and jointly promote the development of Web3 workflow applications.
