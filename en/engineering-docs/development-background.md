# Development Background

## 👥 About the Team

TradingFlow is developed by a passionate small team.

## 💡 Project Origin

Similar to the story of n8n's founders, we discovered that there was no **easy-to-use, open workflow application** in the Web3 world.

So in **March 2025**, we launched the TradingFlow project.

## 🏆 Development Journey

### Hackathon Journey
We continuously participated in various Web3 hackathons and won numerous **top prizes**.

These early positive feedbacks showed us:
- Huge demand for workflow applications from the masses
- Broad prospects for quantitative trading automation
- Possibilities of empowering ordinary users through technology

## 🎯 Our Mission

### "Democratizing Quantitative Trading"
This concept is easy to understand:

**Past:** Only 5% of top engineering and trading experts could profit through automated trading

**Now:** In the wave of artificial intelligence, we hope to empower everyone with this capability

## 🌱 Open Source Plan

### Progressive Decentralization
Based on business realities, we will adopt a **progressive decentralization** approach to open source work.

### First Batch Open Source
**On-Chain Vault** contracts are now open source!

You can view the source code through the following link:
- [GitHub - TradingFlow Contracts](https://github.com/TradingFlow-OpenSource/tradingflow-contracts)

We promise to continue open sourcing more core components and build a truly decentralized workflow platform together with the community.
