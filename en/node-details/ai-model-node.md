## Functionality

AI Model Node receives various data signals from upstream nodes as context, processes them through Large Language Models, and generates structured response data. The node has intelligent output formatting capabilities that automatically adjust output format based on downstream node requirements.

**Main Uses:**
- Analyze market data and generate trading recommendations
- Interpret social media content to extract trading signals
- Make intelligent decisions based on multi-source data
- Generate structured data in specific formats
- Automate complex data analysis tasks

**Core Features:**
- ðŸŽ¯ **Smart Formatting**: Automatically generates JSON format based on downstream requirements
- ðŸ”— **Multi-Signal Fusion**: Integrates multiple input signals for comprehensive analysis
- ðŸ“Š **Structured Extraction**: Automatically extracts structured data from AI responses
- ðŸ¤– **Multi-Model Support**: Supports GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and more models
